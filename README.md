# ALEssistant

An App that assists breweries in inventory/ingredient management, recipe logging, and brew tracking. Brew better.

Sign up or login to start using ALEssistant. Once logged in, start by adding ingredients into your inventory. You can edit ingredients to update your current amount, or the cost on ingredients. You can also delete an ingredient if you no longer want it in your inventory.

Once you have some ingredients in your inventory, you can then begin crafting recipes using these ingredients. You can edit, or delete recipes using the buttons on the panel. To clone a recipe, hit edit on a recipe, then cancel the edit, then click new recipe, and the form will be filled with the prior recipe.

Once you have a recipe that you'd like to brew, click the brew new batch button. Flip over to the brewing tab and youll see your recipe in brew. To progress the state of the brew, hit the arrow and you'll be able to keep track of what state your brew is in. If you want to remove it from the section, hit the X and it will be removed.

Brew Better!
